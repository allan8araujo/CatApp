# AppCat
## [English]
  this project is now avalible on the API site: https://cataas.com/#/integration
  The application was made in order to reduce anxiety symptoms in the midst of some type of crisis. 
  #### You click, you see a cat, simple as that.
  
   It does transform the request into a **bitmap** and display to the user the image, using **retrofit** requisition and **glide** to load image. Also **insert** it to a **database (on room ORM)** to persist the data and display it later to users in a history **tab (navigation)** of cats seen. It is also possible **remove** some catPhotos or **share** it with another apps from the application.
